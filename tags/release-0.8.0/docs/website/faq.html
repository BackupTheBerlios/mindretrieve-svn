<h2>General</h2>
<p class="item"><a name='1.1'>How much diskspace is it going to consume?</a>

<p>This depends on the volume of your web activities. In the case of one
heavy web surfer it is estimated to build a repository of 1GB in 4
years. Finally the repository is bounded by the volume of material one
can read in the life time.


<p class="item"><a name='1.2'>How is this different from the Google Desktop Search?</a>

<p>MindRetrieve's focus is on the World Wide Web with a twist that it
considers the web pages your have seen is most special. It is a desktop
search engine in the sense that it runs locally and serves only you.
However it does not index your files or email.



<h2>Problem</h2>

<p class="item"><a name='2.1'>The MindRetrieve service does not start in Windows</a>

<p>We have observed that on some system MindRetrieve service on Windows
does not start after rebooting sometimes. To manually start it from
command line, simply run:

<blockquote>net start MindRetrieve</blockquote>


<p class="item"><a name='2.2'>Proxy error when access the web</a>

<p>If you see error messages like this when accessing the web:

<p><i>"Could not connect to proxy server"</i>
<p><i>"The connection was refused when attempting to contact the proxy server"</i>
<p>or <i>"The page cannot be displayed"</i> for IE


<p>The MindRetrieve engine is probably not running. You may manually start
the engine. Another possibility is you have uninstalled MindRetrieve
engine. In this case please complete the uninstallation procedure by
resetting your browsers proxy setting.



<h2>Security and Privacy</h2>

<p class="item"><a name='3.1'>Would any of my private data being sent to remote website?</a>

<p>Current all operation are performed locally. No data is sent to any
remote web site at all. In the future if there is any feature that
requires contact of a remote server, let's say remote bookmarking, the
user would be fully aware of it.


<p class="item"><a name='3.2'>What happens for a computer shared by multiple users?</a>

<p>All users on the same computer would share the same repository.


<p class="item"><a name='3.3'>I have a concern that my
parents/spouse/RIAA may find out I have visited certain website if they
have access to my computer.</a>

<p>The upcoming exclude and purge feature will address this.
