<h1>MindRetrieve - Search The Web You Have Seen</h1>
<p>MindRetrieve is a personal search engine. Unlike general purpose search
engines that intent to index and search every web page in the world,
MindRetrieve focus on a small but very special area. That is the web that
you have seen.

<p>Everyday we read a large amount of information from the world wide
web. The truth is most of them does not register. We often search for
similar topics time after time. It is time consuming. Often after much
work we find that we are looking at the same old documents like a déjà
vu. MindRetrieve is here to help you to find information buried deep in your
memory.</p>

<p>MindRetrieve is a lightweight, cross-platform, open source application
available under the BSD license. It works with all popular web browsers.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Windows Installation</h3>
<p>Download and run the <a
href="https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2905">Windows
installer</a>. Then configure your web browser to use MindRetrieve as
the http proxy at port 8051. Instructions for some popular web browsers
are listed below.</p>

<div id="instructions">
<h3>Internet Explorer 6.0</h3> <p class="browser_instruction">Choose the
Tools | Internet Options menu. Click the [Connections] tab. Then click
the [LAN Settings...] button. Check the [Use a proxy server...]
checkbox. Put 'localhost' for address and '8051' for port. Also check
Bypass proxy for local address.(<a href='img/ie_proxy.gif'>screen
shot</a>)</p>

<h3>Mozilla Firefox 1.0</h3>
<p class="browser_instruction">Choose the Tools | Options menu. Click
the [Connections Settings] button. Select the 'Manual proxy
configuration' radio box. Put 'localhost' in the HTTP Proxy field ands
SSL Proxy field. Put '8051' in the port field. (<a
href='img/firefox_proxy.gif'>screen shot</a>)</p>

<h3>Opera 7.5</h3>
<p class="browser_instruction">Open the Preferences
dialog box. Choose network and click the [Proxy Servers] button. Check
the HTTP and HTTPS checkboxes. Put 'localhost' and '8051' in each row.
(<a href='img/opera_proxy.gif'>screen shot</a>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Note if your company of ISP or your company already requires you
to manually configure a proxy to their server, you should set them up as
a chain of proxies. Setup you browser's proxy to MindRetrieve with the
instruction above. Then configure the ISP's proxy in the http_proxy
entry in the http section of in the <b>config.ini</b> file. For example,
if the original proxy is proxy.abc.com at port 1234, edit the entry as
below:</i></p>

<div class="code"><pre>
Config.ini

  [http]
  http_proxy=<u>http://proxy.abc.com:1234/</u>
</div>

<h3>Linux Installation</h3>
<p>First download and install the dependent software components:
<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.python.org/download/'>Python 2.4</a>
<li><a href='http://pylucene.osafoundation.org/'>PyLucene 0.9.6</a>
</ul>

<p>Download and install the <a
href="https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2905">linux
tarball</a>. Configure the browser's proxy setting using the procedure
above. Then start the MindRetrieve engine using this command

<pre>    python run.py --start &amp;</pre>

<p>To stop it, use this command

<pre>    python run.py --start</pre>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>MindRetrieve is now ready to listen and index web traffic for you. For
example, start with a visit to MindRetrieve's <a
href='http://mindretrieve.berlios.de/'>home page</a>. You
may want to click you browser's reload button to ensure it loads a fresh
copy after you have installed MindRetrieve.</p>

<p>Next open and bookmark the MindRetrieve <a href='http://localhost:8050/'
rev="bookmark">start page [http://localhost:8050]</a>. From
there you will be able to search all previously loaded web pages.
Usually an automatic indexing happens in the background periodically.
For instant gratification, click 'config' and 'index now' to index the
page you have just visited.</p>

<p>Let's enter the word 'personal search engine' in the start page. You
should find the MindRetrieve home page, which you have just visited
moments ago. That's it. Happy browsing and searching! Remember to use
the bookmark to back to MindRetrieve's start page. </p>

<h2>Uninstallation</h2>
<p>Should you want to uninstall MindRetrieve, first undo the proxy
configuration from your web browser. For Windows version, use Add/Remove
Program from the Control Panel to uninstall MindRetrieve. Finally if you
want to permanently remove all data collected, simply delete all
remaining files under the directory where you have MindRetrieve installed.

</p>


<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>MindRetrieve works by archiving and indexing all web
messages<sup>*</sup> that go through it. We find this make some very
powerful application. However if you have concern on your web traffic
being archived in any way at all, you should not install and use this
application. </p>

<p>We recognize that your web history is very sensitive private data. In
particular it has lucrative commercial value to advertisers. This
application does not share or transfer your data in any form (unless you
explicitly request it to do so). This is where MindRetrieve stands out from
other similar applications. You do not have to believe in any deceptive
privacy statements. As an open source application its operations can be
independently audited. </p>
